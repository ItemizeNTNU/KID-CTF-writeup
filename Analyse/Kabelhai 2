Kabelhai 2: Judgement day

Skurkene blir bare bedre og bedre, og v√•re analytikere spiser pizzaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa! Kan du finne ut av dette?

Writeup

In this challenge we are given a pcap-file. Opening it up and taking a look at the TCP-streams yields a conversation between our two perps, t0rv4lds4dw1n and 3v1lh4x0r.

The essential to extract from this pcap is the following:

"This next secret is encoded with base64 and encrypted."
"Some awesome XOR-crypting."
"aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaalright."
"Here: AhUHGhlREz4EEz4GVQ8SClI+BA1SDwUIBj4FVRw="


Meaning we are given a base64-encoded string that has been XOR-ed by a value. Seeing as both the task-description and the conversation include tons of exaggerated a's, there is reasons to suspect this might have something to do with the key.

Given some trial and error, one should find that the key is infact 'a' (97).	

Which is easily decoded and decrypted by a couple lines in python.


#!/usr/bin/python
from base64 import b64decode
from itertools import izip, cycle

challenge_string = "AhUHGhlREz4EEz4GVQ8SClI+BA1SDwUIBj4FVRw="

def decrypt_xor(string,key):
	return ''.join(chr(ord(a)^ord(b)) for a,b in izip(string,cycle(key)))


raw_str = b64decode(challenge_string)

flag = decrypt_xor(raw_str,'a')

print "Flagget er: {}\n".format(flag)
