Captcha

Noen ganger kan captcha være veldig slem, spesielt når det gjemmer noe...

You are given a pcap-file. When you look at it, it shows a simple download from i.imgsafe.com. 
When you do a HTTP export, you find a .PNG file. The picture is malformed, giving you information that there might be something hidden in the picture.
Doing a simple strings on the file gives you the flag. When knowing the flag is on the form ctf{ascii}:

root@kali:~# strings 5428e8a9eb.png | grep 'ctf'
ctf{st3n0graph7_1s_eaSy}

Then we have the flag.
