Whats this





In this task you are only given the hint:
«my blt drive on my computer just went awol»


A google-search will yield results where one is a short movie from the movie "Hackers" from 1995.

If you watch the movie you will hear the IP of the target machine: '212.555.42.40'




The flag would then be: 'ctf{212.555.42.40}'

( just entering '212.555.42.40' is also an accepted answer )
