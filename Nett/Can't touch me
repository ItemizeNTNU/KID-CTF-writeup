Can't touch me


TASK:
John has created a webpage, but something went wrong. Now he can't fetch the flag anymore. 

Can you help him?

WRITEUP:
The website shows a single button with the text 'Press me to activate the flag-fetching capability...'. If you press the button another button with the text 'Show flag' will appear. 

The goal of the challenge is to push this button.

If you move your mouse over the button, it moves. If you try to focus it, it disapears. 

By viewing the sourcecode of the webpage you can see that the button has a unique id ('flag-fetcher'), and has a "form submit" action connected to the "onclick" attribute. It would be fair to say that submitting this form is our new more detailed goal.

Submitting the form can be done in two ways;
- Trigger a submit
- Trigger a click

Both can be done by using the browsers javascript console(Chrome: F12 and choose 'Console').


Trigger a click:
By reading the action()-function, the function which hides and show the 'Show flag' button, we can see how the button is referenced.

To trigger a click-event you simply send a click-function to the reference:
	document.getElementById('flag-fetcher').click()


Trigger a submit:
The variable $form holds the form we want to submit. 

To trigger a submit-event you simply send a submit-function to the variable:
	$form.submit()


Will return the flag: ctf{I_hate_when_javascript_does_that}
